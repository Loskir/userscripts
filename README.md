# userscripts
Some userscripts that I made and/or forked

## Zoom open in app

Opens zoom.us links directly in desktop app, skipping zoom's webpage.

To be more precise, it immediately redirects zoom.us links to `zoommtg://` scheme that opens desktop app, and closes the original page.

## Prevent link mangling on Google and Yandex

You might have noticed that when you click on Google or Yandex search result, it redirects you to an intermediate page instead of taking you directly to the search result.

This simple script prevents them from doing so.
